# Water simulation on 2D terrain

This (very early) work implements a simple grid-based 2D terrain modeling with liquid simulation. CUDA is used for simulations and visualization are done with modern shader-based OpenGL.
A report in **german** is available [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=11JHhqISbFBbvi_j3kJsj8EUanhBGpt9j).

I will upload some code soon, mainly for people interested in playing with the code to implement similar ideas, however this won't come with any support from my side.
